Here are some equations
$$ cos $$

$$ \latex $$

And now are want to write a fraction in line \\( \frac{1}{2} \\) and adding text right after it.

SAM IS THE BEST!
<ul>
<li>Want to write fraction in line \\( \frac{1}{2} \\) in a list. Let's try difference ways of doign it here: first $$ \frac{1}{2} $$, second $$\\( \frac{1}{2} \\)$$, third <span>\\( \frac{1}{2} \\)</span>, fourth  <span>$ \frac{1}{2} $</span>, fifth $ \frac{1}{2} $ asdfs,
$$ \frac{1}{2} $$
asdfsdaf</li>
</ul>

blah blah blah

* This is my first list item
    * this is my first sublist item
* Lets put a fraction in second list item \\( \frac{1}{2} \\) right about here.

I'd also like to try doing an ordered list

1. This is my first list item
    1. Sublist item. Lets put a fraction in second list item \\( \frac{1}{2} \\) right about here.
2. This is my second list item
