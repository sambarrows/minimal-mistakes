A data scientist trained in quantitative political science, I love applying statistics and machine learning to drive customer engagement. I'm particularly interested in topics in causal inference.

I'm currently part of Uber's money team in Amsterdam, where I run experimentation, predictive modeling, insights, and reporting for consumer-facing rider payments.

I was previously at at Booking.com, where I worked with product teams across the customer service innovation group to measure and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. 

I earned a Ph.D. in Government from Harvard University, before receiving a postdoctoral fellowship from the Harvard Kennedy School and teaching at the University of Cambridge. My academic research explored the drivers of parentsâ€™ satisfaction and engagement with US public schools. 

I received a B.A. from the University of Oxford, where I majored in economics.
