A data scientist trained in quantitative political science, I love applying statistics and machine learning to understand and drive customer engagement.

Currently employed at Booking.com, the world’s largest accommodation site, I work with product teams across the customer service innovation group to measure and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. 

I earned a Ph.D. in Government from Harvard University, before receiving a postdoctoral fellowship from the Harvard Kennedy School and teaching at the University of Cambridge. My academic research explored the drivers of parents’ satisfaction and engagement with US public schools. I received a B.A. from the University of Oxford, where I majored in economics.
