A data scientist trained in quantitative political science, I love applying statistics and machine learning to drive customer engagement. I'm particularly interested in topics in causal inference.

I'm currently part of Uber's money team in Amsterdam, where I run experimentation, predictive modeling, insights, and reporting for consumer-facing rider payments.

I was previously at at Booking.com, where I worked with product teams across the customer service innovation group to measure and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. 

I began my career using statistical methods to understand the drivers of parents' satisfaction and engagement with public schools, receiving a postdoctoral fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School and teaching at the University of Cambridge.

I earned a Ph.D. in Government from Harvard University and a B.A. from the University of Oxford, where I majored in economics.
