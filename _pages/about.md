I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, and am currently looking to move into a growth marketing or product analyst role. I have over eight yearsâ€™ experience in the design, execution, and analysis of quantitative research projects, working primarily with R and Python. My work uses statistical methods to study the drivers of user satisfaction and engagement with public services.Recent projects have included the first nationally representative study comparing the views of US charter school parents with other sectors, an experiment to investigate the effects of relative performance information on perceptions of public services, and a quasi-experimental study of the effect of school performance information on local elections.This blog is a collection of side-projects, mainly looking at questions concerning digital marketing and understanding user opinions.I am always interested in collaborating, so please reach out if you see anything of interest!
