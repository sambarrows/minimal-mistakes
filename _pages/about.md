A data scientist with an academic background in applied statistics and behavioral science, I love using data to build better products that improve users’ experiences.  I am currently employed at Booking.com, the world’s leading accommodation site, where I work with product teams across the customer service innovation group to increase user engagement and loyalty. I obtained my Ph.D. in quantitative political science from Harvard University, before receiving a postdoctoral fellowship from the Harvard Kennedy School and teaching at the University of Cambridge. My academic research explored the drivers of satisfaction and engagement with US public schools, using experimental and quasi-experimental methods, topic modelling, survey research, and other tools.
